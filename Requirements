Title: Please write a basic survey application in Rails. Since you will be writing test-driven code after you join us, we expect the same on this task also.

Description: The survey application has 2 roles. A survey admin and a survey taker. 

The survey admin should be able to: 

See a list of existing surveys
Create/edit/delete a survey
Add/delete/edit questions to a survey
For each survey, see a list of survey responses from the normal users.
No need of any interface to create admin users, just mark them so manually.

A normal user should be able to: 
See the list of existing surveys
Take a survey (ie. enter answers for all the questions and submit it)
See appropriate validation messages. eg: if he enters a non-numeric value for a numeric question or forgets to answer one of the questions.
See "thanks message" after completing a survey

Apart from these two roles, non-logged users should be able to:

See the list of surveys
Signup (username, email are the required fields and email should be verified)
Login

Types of Questions

Essay question (answer for which is a line of text / paragraph or more)
Numeric question
Date question (answer for which is a date)
While adding a survey question, admin should be able to choose its type. Survey taker should be shown appropriate input options according to the question type. 
Essay - text area
Numeric - text field with smaller width
Date - text field with date picker.
Design should be flexible so that we can add other question types in future (like a multiple choice question)
